# Hospitality Project PowerBi

# Atliq hospitatility visualization

In this project, I followed Codebasics' YouTube tutorial, guided by Abhishek Anand, a revenue manager at OYO, and Hemanand, a data analytics expert. The tutorial walked me through the real-time process of discussing client requirements, creating a dashboard mockup, understanding hospitality domain metrics, cleaning and formatting data, performing data modeling, and generating calculated metrics using DAX.
The aim of my project was to construct a dashboard for Atliq Grands in the Hospitality Domain using Power BI. The primary goal was to enhance my resume by adding a real-time project. The challenge involved providing valuable insights to the Revenue Team at Atliq Grands.
About the client, Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been a key player in the hospitality industry for the past two decades. Facing challenges from competitors and making ineffective management decisions, they were experiencing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
In response, the managing director of Atliq Grands sought to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" as a strategic move to regain their market share and revenue. My contribution to this initiative was to create a Power BI dashboard, offering insights to aid Atliq Grands in their journey towards recovery.
